# Personal Trading Journal
### To measure and test the success rate of the strategies
---

### 1️⃣ The Concept

For each player (card), you want to maintain a **running log** of:

* When you “buy” it (price at that time)
* When you “sell” it (price at that time)
* Profit or loss for that transaction

This is **like a personal trading journal** for FIFA cards. Over time, this will give you:

* Average profit per card
* Cards with consistent upside
* Edge over the market (where your strategy actually works)

---

### 2️⃣ What the “list” looks like

For example, a DataFrame could look like this:

| card_id | name             | buy_time         | buy_price | sell_time        | sell_price | profit |
| ------- | ---------------- | ---------------- | --------- | ---------------- | ---------- | ------ |
| 101     | Patrick Kluivert | 2025-09-27 15:00 | 220000    | 2025-09-28 11:00 | 270000     | 50000  |
| 102     | David Raya       | 2025-09-28 10:00 | 3000      | 2025-09-28 11:30 | 35000      | 32000  |
| 101     | Patrick Kluivert | 2025-09-28 11:15 | 270000    | 2025-09-28 18:00 | 272000     | 2000   |

* Each row is **one buy-sell event**.
* `profit` = `sell_price - buy_price`.
* This is **cumulative over time**.

---

### 3️⃣ How to generate this “ongoing list”

You can:

1. Keep a **database table** called `trades`:

```sql
CREATE TABLE trades (
    trade_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    card_id INT,
    name VARCHAR(255),
    buy_time DATETIME,
    buy_price INT,
    sell_time DATETIME,
    sell_price INT,
    profit INT
);
```

2. Whenever your bot recommends a **buy**, log it in `trades` with `sell_price = NULL`.

3. When you actually sell (or when the bot suggests selling), update `sell_time` and `sell_price`, calculate `profit`.

4. You can query your edge anytime:

```sql
SELECT card_id, name, SUM(profit) as total_profit, AVG(profit) as avg_profit
FROM trades
GROUP BY card_id, name
ORDER BY total_profit DESC;
```

---

### 4️⃣ Visualization / Analysis

Once you have the table:

* **Profit over time** per card → line chart
* **Histogram of profits** → see distribution of wins/losses
* **Edge analysis** → see which cards are consistently profitable

---

### 5️⃣ Key advantage

* This is **different from just suggesting “buy/sell now”**.
* You can see whether your strategy is **actually profitable**, card by card.
* Over time, you can refine thresholds (drop %, min profit, etc.) based on **real historical performance**.
