## Overview

Briefly describe your project:

> This project collects and analyzes FIFA Ultimate Team (FUT) player market data to research and test trading strategies. It stores player stats, prices, playstyles, and historical trends in a PostgreSQL database.

## **Data Scraping**

### Deployed Data Scraper Retrieve Steps

1. Open PuTTy and load fifa settings
2. extract data on fc26_data.ipynb

## Setup

Explain how to set up the project locally:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Shaninhooo/Data-Driven-Trading-Strategy-Research-on-FIFA-Market.git
   ```
2. Create a `.env` file with your PostgreSQL credentials:

   ```env
   DB_NAME=your_db_name
   DB_USER=your_username
   DB_PASSWORD=your_password
   DB_HOST=localhost
   DB_PORT=5432
   ```
3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Run the Python script to initialize the database tables:

   ```bash
   python postgresConnect.py
   ```

## Usage

Explain how someone can use your database or scripts:

* Insert new player data.
* Query historical price trends.
* Analyze player statistics for trading strategies.

Example:

```python
cur.execute("SELECT * FROM price_history WHERE player_id = 1;")
```
